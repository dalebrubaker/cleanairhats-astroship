        We’ve developed a new approach to respiratory safety: a lightweight, comfortable, and effective protective hat that uses molecular diffusion rather than mechanical filtration. Our mission is to promote this innovative technology and make it available to the public—not for profit, but for the public good. Approximately 8 million people worldwide die each year from respiratory diseases and infections, many of which are linked to exposure to smoke, dust, and airborne pathogens—risks that can be mitigated through effective protective measures like the MyAirHat™. The number is greatly increased during pandemics, which seem always to be occurring  somewhere in the world.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">
        We license and distribute the Clean Air Hat technology freely to manufacturers and suppliers so that people around the world can benefit. Our work goes beyond the technology. We educate communities, collaborate with health professionals and researchers, and provide practical resources to help people stay informed and safe. We’re a nonprofit organization dedicated to education, public health, and scientific collaboration.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">
        Clean Air Hats, Inc. plans to operate as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit (as soon as we get IRS approval). We do not support political candidates or campaigns. All income is reinvested into our mission—never for private gain.
