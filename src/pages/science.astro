    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold my-6">The Science Behind MyAirHat™</h1>
    <div class="mt-2 w-full text-gray-700">
      <p class="mb-4">
        Understanding the science behind MyAirHat™ can help explain why it
        works so effectively. While human respiration is complex, the core
        concepts are surprisingly easy to grasp — and they lead naturally into
        the principles behind MyAirHat's design.

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Why Particle Size Matters</h3>

      <p class="mb-4">
        To understand how MyAirHat functions, it helps to visualize the relative
        sizes of particles in the air:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mb-4">
        <li>
          Imagine an oxygen, nitrogen, or carbon dioxide molecule as the size of
          a marble.
        </li>
        <li>
          On that scale, a virus would be the size of a three-story apartment
          building.
        </li>
        <li>
          A human hair — or a cotton thread, which is similar in diameter —
          would be a couple of kilometers wide (over a mile).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mb-4">
        From a molecule's perspective, cotton fabric looks like a wide-open
        structure with enormous gaps. That's why sound waves travel easily
        through fabric and also why small gas molecules can move freely through
        the cotton wall of the MyAirHat.

        How Molecular Diffusion Works
      </h3>

      <p class="mb-4">
        Diffusion is the key scientific principle behind MyAirHat. Britannica
        defines diffusion as:
      </p>
      <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-gray-300 pl-4 italic my-4">
        "A process resulting from random motion of molecules by which there is a
        net flow of matter from a region of high concentration to a region of
        low concentration."
