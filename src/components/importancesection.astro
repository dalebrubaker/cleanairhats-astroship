    <p class="mb-4">
      Respiratory health issues, including diseases caused by respiratory
      viruses, exposure to smoke, dust, and other airborne pollutants,
      contribute significantly to global mortality. Here's a summary of the
      estimated annual deaths associated with these factors:

    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 text-sm mb-4">
      <li>
        <strong>Overlap in Categories:</strong> It's important to note that these
        categories are not mutually exclusive. For instance, air pollution is a significant
        risk factor for both chronic respiratory diseases and lung cancer. Therefore,
        simply summing these figures would lead to double-counting.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Use of Masks:</strong> Masks are commonly used to protect against
        airborne particles, including those from smoke, dust, and pathogens responsible
        for respiratory infections. While they can reduce exposure and potentially
        lower the risk of developing related health issues, their effectiveness varies
        based on the type of mask, proper usage, and the specific pollutant or pathogen.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-sm">
      Addressing these respiratory health challenges requires a multifaceted
      approach, including reducing air pollution, improving indoor air quality,
      promoting vaccination against respiratory pathogens, and encouraging the
      use of appropriate respiratory protection when necessary.

      <p class="mb-4">
        Because we can't see all the stuff in the air around us, most of us have
        a false sense of security when we are in a room with other people for a
        long time. Our bodies are wonderfully capable of handling small doses of
        viruses and other exposures, but we can't handle new viruses and virus
        mutations, resulting in the occasional pandemic. And some of us have
        weaker immune systems and can't handle the exposures as well.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        The following discusses Covid-19, the novel (new) coronavirus that swept
        the world in 2020. The American Lung Association says, "Rhinovirus is
        the most common cause, accounting for 10 to 40 percent of colds. Other
        common cold viruses include coronavirus and respiratory syncytial virus
        (RSV)." And of course, influenza is a virus.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="mt-6">
      <h2 class="text-1xl font-bold mb-4">Virus Concentration</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        One study reported the number live copies of the Covid-19 virus in the
        oral fluid to be at least 7 million per milliliter (35 million per
        teaspoon). Respiratory viruses are created in the breeding ground of
        ideal temperature and moisture conditions in the sinus cavities behind
        our noses.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        When we breathe, we expel water droplets. The biggest droplets are
        likely to fall to the ground within 1 to 2 meters, where they quickly
        die. But the smallest droplets (especially from a cough) go out as very
        tiny droplets, called a fog or mist or aerosol. The aerosol can hang in
        a room for hours and hours. One study measured 0.87 copies of the live
        virus per liter in a room containing someone infected with Covid-19.
        That may not seem huge, but 200 square foot room with an 8 foot ceiling
        contains 45,000 liters of air and would thus contain about 40,000 copies
        of the live virus.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="mt-6">
      <h2 class="text-1xl font-bold mb-4">Breathing Rate and Exposure</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        The breathing rate for adults is in the range of 12 to 18 breaths per
        minute. The following example assumes 15. Each time we inhale, we suck
        in about half a liter of air. That means we inhale 450 liters (120
        gallons) of air per hour, containing about 400 live viruses. Each person
        in the room is respirating (breathing) 1% of the entire room volume. If
        there are 10 people in the room, together they breathe 10% of the air in
        the room every hour, or 100% after the room has been occupied for 10
        hours. Without MyAirHatâ„¢, every person in the room is continually
        inhaling the air into which the other nine people are exhaling.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        One study found that hospital restroom and break areas were the most
        likely places for hospital workers to catch Covid-19. If you only wear a
        MyAirHat when you go into a public restroom, you might significantly
        reduce your risk of contracting a virus.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="mt-6">
      <h2 class="text-1xl font-bold mb-4">Example Summary</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        In this example, based on the extensive real-world testing discussed
        earlier, you would inhale 228 viruses (57% of 400) if you wore an N95
        mask or only 76 viruses (19% of 400) if you wore a MyAirHat. After 10
        hours the difference is 2,280 compared to 760. The higher virus load
        significantly increases the risk of serious illness or death.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        The same example would apply to smoke or other particles. If you are
        trying to escape a burning skyscraper, the difference could mean
        succumbing to smoke inhalation or survival.
