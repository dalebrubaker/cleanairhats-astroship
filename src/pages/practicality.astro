        <strong>MyAirHat™</strong> is designed not only to be safer—but also reusable,
        comfortable, and realistic for everyday life.

            <li>
              Unlike disposable masks that fill up with particles and lose
              effectiveness, <strong>MyAirHat™ can be reused</strong> daily.
            </li>
            <li>
              Viruses require moisture to survive—simply <strong
                >drying the hat overnight</strong
              > (e.g., in a clothes dryer) removes this moisture and renders viruses
              inactive.
            </li>
            <li>
              For deeper cleaning, the hat can be <strong
                >hand-washed or run on a delicate cycle once per week</strong
              >.
            </li>
            <li>
              Built primarily from <strong>biodegradable cotton</strong> and a recyclable
              window shield, it's a low-waste, long-term solution.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p class="text-gray-700">
            Frequent replacement of disposable or N95-style masks can add up
            quickly. <strong>MyAirHat™ is built to last</strong>, making it a
            more affordable choice over time—especially for those who need
            protection every day.

            Ships Flat, Assembles to Fit
          </h3>
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700">
            <li>
              The hat ships in two parts—a hat and a fabric cylinder that
              includes the window shield and drawstrings at each end—to reduce
              shipping bulk and allow easy storage.
            </li>
            <li>
              When assembled, the shield naturally curves along the brim for
              good fit and visibility.
            </li>
            <li>
              This design allows for <strong>adjustments at the top</strong> of the
              shield to better fit different users.
            </li>
            <li>
              For added stability, users can optionally <strong
                >attach the shield to the hat with safety pins</strong
              > once properly adjusted.
            </li>

            Appearance: Different by Design
          </h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">
            We know MyAirHat™ doesn't look like a typical mask—and that's the
            point. Traditional masks cover the face and muffle the voice.
            MyAirHat™ keeps your face and words visible, making communication
            easier and allowing you to maintain"connection" with others.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mt-2">
            Yes, it looks unusual at first. But it's also expressive, open, and
            honest. <strong>Wearing one shows thoughtfulness and courage</strong
            >—and that you care about protecting others while staying present
            and visible.
          </p>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">
            Eat & Drink Without Full Exposure
          </h3>
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700">
            <li>
              Thanks to passive molecular diffusion, you can <strong
                >briefly loosen the drawstring</strong
              > and reach inside to eat or drink—without removing the hat entirely.
            </li>
            <li>
              You're still breathing a filtered pocket of air inside the shield,
              with <strong>minimal exchange with the surrounding air</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>
              This makes MyAirHat™ ideal for use in settings where eating or
              hydration is necessary but full exposure isn't safe.
            </li>
            <li>
              Of course, openings should be as brief and infrequent as
              possible—but this flexibility adds real-world comfort and
              practicality.
