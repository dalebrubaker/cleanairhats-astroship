      <p class="mb-4">
        When wearing a MyAirHat™, each breath you take is about half a liter
        (approximately one pint) of air, containing roughly 80% nitrogen, 20%
        oxygen, and 0.04% carbon dioxide. Exhaled air typically consists of
        about 80% nitrogen, 16% oxygen, and 4% carbon dioxide.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Unlike masks, the MyAirHat™ provides a spacious breathing environment
        beneath the hat. Initially, the carbon dioxide concentration inside this
        space increases slightly with your breathing, then stabilizes quickly.
        Because the MyAirHat™ is constructed from breathable fabric, carbon
        dioxide diffuses naturally from inside the hat to the outside air.
        Thanks to the large surface area of breathable fabric, an equilibrium is
        swiftly reached at comfortably low carbon dioxide levels—balancing the
        amount exhaled with the diffusion through the fabric. Scientifically,
        this diffusion process occurs due to differences in "partial pressure"
        (Dalton's Law).
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        The MyAirHat™ weighs less than five ounces and is made from soft,
        breathable cotton, ensuring lightweight comfort throughout use.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Another key comfort feature is the freedom to breathe naturally. Unlike
        traditional masks that require you to blow and suck air through a
        restrictive mask wall, the MyAirHat™ allows for unrestricted breathing.
        The walls of the hat move gently in and out as you inhale and exhale,
        eliminating any pressure buildup. Speech is not muffled.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        While the MyAirHat™ is designed for comfort, it may feel somewhat warm
        and humid inside, similar to the sensation of breathing under a light
        cover or sheet in bed. This is a natural result of the enclosed
        breathing environment.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        <strong>Note:</strong> The MyAirHat™ is not designed for outdoor use in
        cold weather. Condensation may occur on the shield window, leading to fogging.
        For optimal performance, use in indoor or moderate-temperature environments.
