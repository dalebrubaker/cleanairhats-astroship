            a significant risk factor for both chronic respiratory diseases and lung

            for respiratory infections. While they can reduce exposure and potentially
            lower the risk of developing related health issues, their effectiveness

          <p class="mb-4">
            Because we can't see all the stuff in the air around us, most of us
            have a false sense of security when we are in a room with other
            people for a long time. Our bodies are wonderfully capable of
            handling small doses of viruses and other exposures, but we can't
            handle new viruses and virus mutations, resulting in the occasional
            pandemic. And some of us have weaker immune systems and can't handle
            the exposures as well.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
            The following discusses Covid-19, the novel (new) coronavirus that
            swept the world in 2020. The American Lung Association says,
            "Rhinovirus is the most common cause, accounting for 10 to 40
            percent of colds. Other common cold viruses include coronavirus and
            respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)." And of course, influenza is a
            virus.

          <p class="mb-4">
            One study reported the number live copies of the Covid-19 virus in
            the oral fluid to be at least 7 million per milliliter (35 million
            per teaspoon). Respiratory viruses are created in the breeding
            ground of ideal temperature and moisture conditions in the sinus
            cavities behind our noses.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
            When we breathe, we expel water droplets. The biggest droplets are
            likely to fall to the ground within 1 to 2 meters, where they
            quickly die. But the smallest droplets (especially from a cough) go
            out as very tiny droplets, called a fog or mist or aerosol. The
            aerosol can hang in a room for hours and hours. One study measured
            0.87 copies of the live virus per liter in a room containing someone
            infected with Covid-19. That may not seem huge, but 200 square foot
            room with an 8 foot ceiling contains 45,000 liters of air and would
            thus contain about 40,000 copies of the live virus.

            Breathing Rate and Exposure
          </h3>
          <p class="mb-4">
            The breathing rate for adults is in the range of 12 to 18 breaths
            per minute. The following example assumes 15. Each time we inhale,
            we suck in about half a liter of air. That means we inhale 450
            liters (120 gallons) of air per hour, containing about 400 live
            viruses. Each person in the room is respirating (breathing) 1% of
            the entire room volume. If there are 10 people in the room, together
            they breathe 10% of the air in the room every hour, or 100% after
            the room has been occupied for 10 hours. Without MyAirHat™, every
            person in the room is continually inhaling the air into which the
            other nine people are exhaling.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
            One study found that hospital restroom and break areas were the most
            likely places for hospital workers to catch Covid-19. If you only
            wear a MyAirHat when you go into a public restroom, you might
            significantly reduce your risk of contracting a virus.

        <div class="mt-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Example Summary</h3>
          <p class="mb-4">
            In this example, based on the extensive real-world testing discussed
            earlier, you would inhale 228 viruses (57% of 400) if you wore an
            N95 mask or only 76 viruses (19% of 400) if you wore a MyAirHat.
            After 10 hours the difference is 2,280 compared to 760. The higher
            virus load significantly increases the risk of serious illness or
            death.

          <p class="mb-4">
            The same example would apply to smoke or other particles. If you are

      <div class="mt-2 w-full text-gray-700">
        <p class="mb-4">
          When wearing a MyAirHat™, each breath you take is about half a liter
          (approximately one pint) of air, containing roughly 80% nitrogen, 20%
          oxygen, and 0.04% carbon dioxide. Exhaled air typically consists of
          about 80% nitrogen, 16% oxygen, and 4% carbon dioxide.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Unlike masks, the MyAirHat™ provides a spacious breathing environment
          beneath the hat. Initially, the carbon dioxide concentration inside
          this space increases slightly with your breathing, then stabilizes
          quickly. Because the MyAirHat™ is constructed from breathable fabric,
          carbon dioxide diffuses naturally from inside the hat to the outside
          air. Thanks to the large surface area of breathable fabric, an
          equilibrium is swiftly reached at comfortably low carbon dioxide
          levels—balancing the amount exhaled with the diffusion through the
          fabric. Scientifically, this diffusion process occurs due to
          differences in "partial pressure" (Dalton's Law).
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          The MyAirHat™ weighs less than five ounces and is made from soft,
          breathable cotton, ensuring lightweight comfort throughout use.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Another key comfort feature is the freedom to breathe naturally.
          Unlike traditional masks that require you to blow and suck air through
          a restrictive mask wall, the MyAirHat™ allows for unrestricted
          breathing. The walls of the hat move gently in and out as you inhale
          and exhale, eliminating any pressure buildup. Speech is not muffled.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          While the MyAirHat™ is designed for comfort, it may feel somewhat
          warm and humid inside, similar to the sensation of breathing under a
          light cover or sheet in bed. This is a natural result of the enclosed
          breathing environment.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          <strong>Note:</strong> The MyAirHat™ is not designed for outdoor use in
          cold weather. Condensation may occur on the shield window, leading to fogging.
          For optimal performance, use in indoor or moderate-temperature environments.

              Frequent replacement of disposable or N95-style masks can add up
              quickly. <strong>MyAirHat™ is built to last</strong>, making it a
              more affordable choice over time—especially for those who need
              protection every day.

                The hat ships in two parts—a hat and a fabric cylinder that
                includes the window shield and drawstrings at each end—to reduce
                shipping bulk and allow easy storage.
              </li>
              <li>
                When assembled, the shield naturally curves along the brim for
                good fit and visibility.
              </li>
              <li>
                This design allows for <strong>adjustments at the top</strong> of
                the shield to better fit different users.

              <li>
                For added stability, users can optionally <strong

                > once properly adjusted.

              We know MyAirHat™ doesn't look like a typical mask—and that's the
              point. Traditional masks cover the face and muffle the voice.
              MyAirHat™ keeps your face and words visible, making communication
              easier and allowing you to maintain"connection" with others.

              Yes, it looks unusual at first. But it's also expressive, open,
              and honest. <strong

              <li>
                Thanks to passive molecular diffusion, you can <strong
                  >briefly loosen the drawstring</strong
                > and reach inside to eat or drink—without removing the hat entirely.
              </li>
              <li>
                You're still breathing a filtered pocket of air inside the
                shield, with <strong
                  >minimal exchange with the surrounding air</strong
                >.
              </li>
              <li>
                This makes MyAirHat™ ideal for use in settings where eating or
                hydration is necessary but full exposure isn't safe.

                Of course, openings should be as brief and infrequent as
                possible—but this flexibility adds real-world comfort and
                practicality.
