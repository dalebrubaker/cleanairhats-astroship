      Understanding the science behind MyAirHat™ can help explain why it works
      so effectively. While human respiration is complex, the core concepts are
      surprisingly easy to grasp — and they lead naturally into the principles
      behind MyAirHat's design.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Why Particle Size Matters</h3>

    <p class="mb-4">
      To understand how MyAirHat functions, it helps to visualize the relative
      sizes of particles in the air:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mb-4">
      <li>
        Imagine an oxygen, nitrogen, or carbon dioxide molecule as the size of a
        marble.
      </li>
      <li>
        On that scale, a virus would be the size of a three-story apartment
        building.
      </li>
      <li>
        A human hair — or a cotton thread, which is similar in diameter — would
        be a couple of kilometers wide (over a mile).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mb-4">
      From a molecule's perspective, cotton fabric looks like a wide-open
      structure with enormous gaps. That's why sound waves travel easily through
      fabric and also why small gas molecules can move freely through the cotton
      wall of the MyAirHat.

      How Molecular Diffusion Works
    </h3>

    <p class="mb-4">
      Diffusion is the key scientific principle behind MyAirHat. Britannica
      defines diffusion as:
    </p>
    <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-gray-300 pl-4 italic my-4">
      "A process resulting from random motion of molecules by which there is a
      net flow of matter from a region of high concentration to a region of low
      concentration."
    </blockquote>
    <p class="mb-4">
      You've experienced diffusion any time you've smelled perfume spreading
      through a room — the scent molecules move naturally through the air
      without needing to be blown or pumped.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">
      Diffusion in the Lungs — and in MyAirHat
    </h3>

    <p class="mb-4">
      Human lungs rely on diffusion too. Each adult lung contains about 300
      million alveoli, tiny sacs that expose inhaled air to your bloodstream.
      The total surface area is roughly the size of a tennis court, separated
      only by a thin membrane where oxygen enters the blood and carbon dioxide
      exits.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      The MyAirHat doesn't need anywhere near that surface area, because gas
      diffusion is about 100,000 times faster in air than in liquid. The cotton
      wall of the hat provides enough surface area to allow for the passive
      exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-2 font-medium">Here's what happens during use:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mb-4">
      <li>
        After a few minutes of breathing inside the MyAirHat, carbon dioxide
        levels inside the hat become several times higher than outside — but
        still below recommended safe limits, as discussed in the Safety section.
      </li>
      <li>
        At the same time, oxygen levels inside the hat are quite a bit lower
        than the levels outside.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Despite these differences, the small, fast-moving gas molecules — in
      constant Brownian motion — continue to diffuse naturally across the cotton
      fabric wall. Oxygen enters, carbon dioxide exits. No fans, filters, or
      moving parts required.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">
      Why It Doesn't Need a Tight Seal
    </h3>

    <p class="mb-4">
      Unlike masks or respirators, MyAirHat doesn't require a tight seal around
      the face or neck. That's because there's no significant pressure forcing
      air in or out — just gentle expansion and contraction.
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mb-4">
      <li>When you exhale, the bag slightly expands or billows out.</li>
      <li>When you inhale, it gently draws inward.</li>
      <li>
        This keeps the internal pressure nearly equal to the outside air, so air
        doesn't rush in or out through small gaps.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mb-4">
      This is the opposite of a traditional mask, where any gap drastically
      reduces filtration efficiency, because the pressure forces unfiltered air
      through leaks. That's why respirators must be sealed to the skin with
      petroleum jelly to achieve ideal efficiencies — to ensure the air is
      actually passing through the filter media, not around it.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">What Doesn't Move</h3>

    <p class="mb-4">
      Because nitrogen levels are essentially the same on both sides of the
      fabric, there is no net flow of nitrogen in or out. The same is true for
      dust, pollen, and viruses — once the hat is on, they mostly stay put.
      That's why it's important to put on your MyAirHat in clean,
      well-ventilated air, such as outdoors or by an open window.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Diffusion vs. Filtration</h3>

    <p class="mb-4">
      Traditional masks use filtration and pressure — your lungs pull air in
      through a material barrier, then push it back out. MyAirHat takes a
      different approach. It uses passive molecular diffusion, driven by natural
      concentration differences and the incredible speed of gas molecules.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4 italic font-medium">
      It's not a filter. It's a physics engine — powered by air molecules doing
      what they always do.
