    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold my-6">The Science Behind MyAirHat™</h1>
    <div class="mt-2 w-full text-gray-700">
      <p class="mb-4">
        Understanding the science behind MyAirHat™ can help explain why it
        works so effectively. While human respiration is complex, the core
        concepts are surprisingly easy to grasp — and they lead naturally into
        the principles behind MyAirHat's design.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Why Particle Size Matters</h3>

      <p class="mb-4">
        To understand how MyAirHat functions, it helps to visualize the relative
        sizes of particles in the air:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mb-4">
        <li>
          Imagine an oxygen, nitrogen, or carbon dioxide molecule as the size of
          a marble.
        </li>
        <li>
          On that scale, a virus would be the size of a three-story apartment
          building.
        </li>
        <li>
          A human hair — or a cotton thread, which is similar in diameter —
          would be a couple of kilometers wide (over a mile).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mb-4">
        From a molecule's perspective, cotton fabric looks like a wide-open
        structure with enormous gaps. That's why sound waves travel easily
        through fabric and also why small gas molecules can move freely through
        the cotton wall of the MyAirHat.

        How Molecular Diffusion Works
      </h3>

      <p class="mb-4">
        Diffusion is the key scientific principle behind MyAirHat. Britannica
        defines diffusion as:
      </p>
      <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-gray-300 pl-4 italic my-4">
        "A process resulting from random motion of molecules by which there is a
        net flow of matter from a region of high concentration to a region of
        low concentration."
      </blockquote>
      <p class="mb-4">
        You've experienced diffusion any time you've smelled perfume spreading
        through a room — the scent molecules move naturally through the air
        without needing to be blown or pumped.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">
        Diffusion in the Lungs — and in MyAirHat
      </h3>

      <p class="mb-4">
        Human lungs rely on diffusion too. Each adult lung contains about 300
        million alveoli, tiny sacs that expose inhaled air to your bloodstream.
        The total surface area is roughly the size of a tennis court, separated
        only by a thin membrane where oxygen enters the blood and carbon dioxide
        exits.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        The MyAirHat doesn't need anywhere near that surface area, because gas
        diffusion is about 100,000 times faster in air than in liquid. The
        cotton wall of the hat provides enough surface area to allow for the
        passive exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-2 font-medium">Here's what happens during use:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mb-4">
        <li>
          After a few minutes of breathing inside the MyAirHat, carbon dioxide
          levels inside the hat become several times higher than outside — but
          still below recommended safe limits, as discussed in the Safety
          section.
        </li>
        <li>
          At the same time, oxygen levels inside the hat are quite a bit lower
          than the levels outside.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Despite these differences, the small, fast-moving gas molecules — in
        constant Brownian motion — continue to diffuse naturally across the
        cotton fabric wall. Oxygen enters, carbon dioxide exits. No fans,
        filters, or moving parts required.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">
        Why It Doesn't Need a Tight Seal
      </h3>

      <p class="mb-4">
        Unlike masks or respirators, MyAirHat doesn't require a tight seal
        around the face or neck. That's because there's no significant pressure
        forcing air in or out — just gentle expansion and contraction.
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mb-4">
        <li>When you exhale, the bag slightly expands or billows out.</li>
        <li>When you inhale, it gently draws inward.</li>
        <li>
          This keeps the internal pressure nearly equal to the outside air, so
          air doesn't rush in or out through small gaps.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mb-4">
        This is the opposite of a traditional mask, where any gap drastically
        reduces filtration efficiency, because the pressure forces unfiltered
        air through leaks. That's why respirators must be sealed to the skin
        with petroleum jelly to achieve ideal efficiencies — to ensure the air
        is actually passing through the filter media, not around it.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">What Doesn't Move</h3>

      <p class="mb-4">
        Because nitrogen levels are essentially the same on both sides of the
        fabric, there is no net flow of nitrogen in or out. The same is true for
        dust, pollen, and viruses — once the hat is on, they mostly stay put.
        That's why it's important to put on your MyAirHat in clean,
        well-ventilated air, such as outdoors or by an open window.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Diffusion vs. Filtration</h3>

      <p class="mb-4">
        Traditional masks use filtration and pressure — your lungs pull air in
        through a material barrier, then push it back out. MyAirHat takes a
        different approach. It uses passive molecular diffusion, driven by
        natural concentration differences and the incredible speed of gas
        molecules.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4 italic font-medium">
        It's not a filter. It's a physics engine — powered by air molecules
        doing what they always do.
