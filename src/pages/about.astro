        Clean Air Hats is a non-profit organization dedicated to improving
        public respiratory health through innovative technology. Our mission is
        to educate the public and provide access to a new approach to personal
        air safety.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">
        Currently, we are distributing early prototypes of the MyAirHat™—a
        lightweight, comfortable protective hat—in exchange for donations. This
        allows us to gather valuable feedback, further our research, and support
        our educational outreach while making this new technology accessible.
        Your contribution directly supports our public health mission.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">
        The MyAirHat™ utilizes molecular diffusion rather than traditional
        mechanical filtration, offering effective protection against airborne
        particles like viruses, smoke, and dust. Sadly, respiratory issues
        contribute to approximately 8 million deaths globally each year, a
        number that surges during pandemics. We believe better protective
        measures can make a difference.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">
        To maximize accessibility, we plan to license the Clean Air Hat
        technology freely to manufacturers worldwide. We collaborate with health
        professionals and researchers to continuously improve and validate the
        technology, ensuring it meets real-world needs.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-4">
        Clean Air Hats, Inc. is operating with the intent to secure 501(c)(3)
        non-profit status (pending IRS approval). We do not support political
        candidates or campaigns. All income received through donations is
        reinvested directly into our mission—never for private gain.
