          We've developed a new approach to respiratory safety: a lightweight,
          comfortable, and effective protective hat that uses molecular
          diffusion rather than mechanical filtration. Our mission is to promote
          this innovative technology and make it available to the public—not for
          profit, but for the public good. Approximately 8 million people
          worldwide die each year from respiratory diseases and infections, many
          of which are linked to exposure to smoke, dust, and airborne
          pathogens—risks that can be mitigated through effective protective
          measures like the MyAirHat™. The number is greatly increased during
          pandemics, which seem always to be occurring somewhere in the world.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg mb-4">
          We license and distribute the Clean Air Hat technology freely to
          manufacturers and suppliers so that people around the world can
          benefit. Our work goes beyond the technology. We educate communities,
          collaborate with health professionals and researchers, and provide
          practical resources to help people stay informed and safe. We're a
          nonprofit organization dedicated to education, public health, and
          scientific collaboration.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg mb-4">
          Clean Air Hats, Inc. plans to operate as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit (as
          soon as we get IRS approval). We do not support political candidates
          or campaigns. All income is reinvested into our mission—never for
          private gain.
