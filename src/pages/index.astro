            <strong>Overlap in Categories:</strong> It's important to note that these
            categories are not mutually exclusive. For instance, air pollution is
            a significant risk factor for both chronic respiratory diseases and lung
            cancer. Therefore, simply summing these figures would lead to double-counting.

            airborne particles, including those from smoke, dust, and pathogens responsible
            for respiratory infections. While they can reduce exposure and potentially
            lower the risk of developing related health issues, their effectiveness
            varies based on the type of mask, proper usage, and the specific pollutant
            or pathogen.

          Addressing these respiratory health challenges requires a multifaceted

          encouraging the use of appropriate respiratory protection when
          necessary.

            Because we can't see all the stuff in the air around us, most of us
            have a false sense of security when we are in a room with other
            people for a long time. Our bodies are wonderfully capable of
            handling small doses of viruses and other exposures, but we can't
            handle new viruses and virus mutations, resulting in the occasional
            pandemic. And some of us have weaker immune systems and can't handle
            the exposures as well.

            The following discusses Covid-19, the novel (new) coronavirus that
            swept the world in 2020. The American Lung Association says,
            "Rhinovirus is the most common cause, accounting for 10 to 40
            percent of colds. Other common cold viruses include coronavirus and
            respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)." And of course, influenza is a
            virus.

          <p class="mb-4">
            One study reported the number live copies of the Covid-19 virus in
            the oral fluid to be at least 7 million per milliliter (35 million
            per teaspoon). Respiratory viruses are created in the breeding
            ground of ideal temperature and moisture conditions in the sinus
            cavities behind our noses.

          <p class="mb-4">
            When we breathe, we expel water droplets. The biggest droplets are
            likely to fall to the ground within 1 to 2 meters, where they
            quickly die. But the smallest droplets (especially from a cough) go
            out as very tiny droplets, called a fog or mist or aerosol. The
            aerosol can hang in a room for hours and hours. One study measured
            0.87 copies of the live virus per liter in a room containing someone
            infected with Covid-19. That may not seem huge, but 200 square foot
            room with an 8 foot ceiling contains 45,000 liters of air and would
            thus contain about 40,000 copies of the live virus.

            The breathing rate for adults is in the range of 12 to 18 breaths
            per minute. The following example assumes 15. Each time we inhale,
            we suck in about half a liter of air. That means we inhale 450
            liters (120 gallons) of air per hour, containing about 400 live
            viruses. Each person in the room is respirating (breathing) 1% of
            the entire room volume. If there are 10 people in the room, together
            they breathe 10% of the air in the room every hour, or 100% after
            the room has been occupied for 10 hours. Without MyAirHat™, every
            person in the room is continually inhaling the air into which the
            other nine people are exhaling.

          <p class="mb-4">
            One study found that hospital restroom and break areas were the most
            likely places for hospital workers to catch Covid-19. If you only
            wear a MyAirHat when you go into a public restroom, you might
            significantly reduce your risk of contracting a virus.

          <p class="mb-4">
            In this example, based on the extensive real-world testing discussed
            earlier, you would inhale 228 viruses (57% of 400) if you wore an
            N95 mask or only 76 viruses (19% of 400) if you wore a MyAirHat.
            After 10 hours the difference is 2,280 compared to 760. The higher
            virus load significantly increases the risk of serious illness or
            death.

            The same example would apply to smoke or other particles. If you are

            succumbing to smoke inhalation or survival.
