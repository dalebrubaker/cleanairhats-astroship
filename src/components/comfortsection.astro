    <p class="mb-4">
      When wearing a MyAirHat™, each breath you take is about half a liter
      (approximately one pint) of air, containing roughly 80% nitrogen, 20%
      oxygen, and 0.04% carbon dioxide. Exhaled air typically consists of about
      80% nitrogen, 16% oxygen, and 4% carbon dioxide.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Unlike masks, the MyAirHat™ provides a spacious breathing environment
      beneath the hat. Initially, the carbon dioxide concentration inside this
      space increases slightly with your breathing, then stabilizes quickly.
      Because the MyAirHat™ is constructed from breathable fabric, carbon
      dioxide diffuses naturally from inside the hat to the outside air. Thanks
      to the large surface area of breathable fabric, an equilibrium is swiftly
      reached at comfortably low carbon dioxide levels—balancing the amount
      exhaled with the diffusion through the fabric. Scientifically, this
      diffusion process occurs due to differences in "partial pressure"
      (Dalton's Law).
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      The MyAirHat™ weighs less than five ounces and is made from soft,
      breathable cotton, ensuring lightweight comfort throughout use.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Another key comfort feature is the freedom to breathe naturally. Unlike
      traditional masks that require you to blow and suck air through a
      restrictive mask wall, the MyAirHat™ allows for unrestricted breathing.
      The walls of the hat move gently in and out as you inhale and exhale,
      eliminating any pressure buildup. Speech is not muffled.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      While the MyAirHat™ is designed for comfort, it may feel somewhat warm
      and humid inside, similar to the sensation of breathing under a light
      cover or sheet in bed. This is a natural result of the enclosed breathing
      environment.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      <strong>Note:</strong> The MyAirHat™ is not designed for outdoor use in cold
      weather. Condensation may occur on the shield window, leading to fogging. For
      optimal performance, use in indoor or moderate-temperature environments.
